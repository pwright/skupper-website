== Creating a site using the Skupper Operator


. Create a YAML file defining the ConfigMap of the site you want to create.
+
--
For example, create `skupper-site.yaml` that provisions a site with a console:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
include::../examples/site-cm.yaml[]

----

NOTE: Currently, you must enable the console on the same site as you enable the flow collector.

You can also create a site without a console:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
include::../examples/no-console.yaml[]
----
--

. Apply the YAML to create a ConfigMap named `skupper-site` in the namespace you want to use:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ kubectl apply -f skupper-site.yaml
----

. Verify that the site is created by checking that the Skupper router and service controller pods are running:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
skupper-router-8c6cc6d76-27562                1/1     Running   0          40s
skupper-service-controller-57cdbb56c5-vc7s2   1/1     Running   0          34s

NOTE: If you deployed the Operator to a single namespace, an additional site controller pod is also running.
