== Supported standards and protocols

Skupper supports the following protocols for your {service-network}:

* TCP - default
* HTTP1
* HTTP2

When exposing or creating a service, you can specify the protocol, for example:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ skupper expose deployment hello-world-backend --port 8080 --protocol <protocol> 
----

where `<protocol>` can be:

* tcp
* http
* http2


When choosing which protocol to specify, note the following:

* `tcp` supports any protocol overlayed on TCP, for example, HTTP1 and HTTP2 work when you specify `tcp`.
* If you specify `http` or `http2`, the IP address reported by a client may not be accessible.
* All {service-network} traffic is converted to AMQP messages in order to traverse the {service-network}.
+
TCP is implemented as a single streamed message, whereas HTTP1 and HTTP2 are implemented as request/response message routing.
