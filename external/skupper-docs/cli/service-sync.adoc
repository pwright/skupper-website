= Service synchronization

By default, `skupper init` creates a site that synchronizes all services from other sites that also have synchronization enabled.

To disable service synchronization:

[source, bash, subs=attributes+]
----
$ skupper init --service-sync false
----

To check whether synchronization is enabled, check the value for `service-sync` in the output from the following command:

[source, bash, subs=attributes+]
----
$ kubectl get cm skupper-site -o json 
----

Notes:

* When considering whether services are synchronized between two sites, `service-sync` must be enabled on both sites.
* If you use the command `skupper service delete` on a site, that command only works if the service was created on that site.
