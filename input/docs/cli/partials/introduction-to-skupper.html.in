<p>A {service-network} enables communication between services running in different network locations.
It allows geographically distributed services to connect as if they were all running in the same site.</p>

<img src="../../_images/overview.svg" alt="This diagram shows a 'service network' connecting two Kubernetes clusters. The Skupper site in Namespace A, in the left cluster, has a deployment which exposes a TCP service to the service network. In the right cluster two sites can use that service as if the service existed in the right cluster.">

<p>For example, you can deploy your frontend in a public {kubernetes-flavor} cluster and deploy your backend in a private {kubernetes-flavor} cluster, then connect them into a {service-network}.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A {service-network} provides the following features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Security by default. All inter-site traffic is protected by mutual TLS using a private, dedicated certificate authority (CA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy connections between {kubernetes-flavor} clusters, even private clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A {service-network} supports existing TCP-based applications without requiring modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor your application traffic spread across multiple {kubernetes-flavor} clusters using the {service-network} console.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You deploy and manage a {service-network} using the <code>skupper</code> CLI.</p>
