## Project commands

You can use the `./plano` command in the root of the project to
perform project tasks.  It accepts a subcommand.  Use `./plano --help`
to list the available commands.

## Rendering the site

You can use the `./plano render` command in the root of the project to
render the site:

$ ./plano render
--> render

For development, you can serve the site locally.  Any changes you make
to the input files are rendered on demand.

```console
$ ./plano serve
--> serve
